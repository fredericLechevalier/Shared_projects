BSQ is an algorythm made to find the biggest square in empty space within a given area.
You must provide the program with a area file from the "Area_files" folder.
BSQ will draw the biggest square possible and display it on the terminal.

an empty space is represented by the character '.'
an obstacle is represented by the character 'o'
the square found by BSQ will be made with 'x' characters

Here is how to use the program :

./bsq Area_files/intermediate_map_100_100

or replace "intermediate_map_100_100" by the name of another file you'd like to try BSQ with.
